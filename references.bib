abstract = {A wireless sensor network is a group of network nodes which collaborate with each other in a sophisticated fashion. It is built of nodes from a few to several hundreds or even thousands, where each node is connected to one (or sometimes several) sensors. In WSN, Second layer of the OSI reference layer is a data link layer which has a sub layer of Medium Access Control. The choice of Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol has a direct bearing on the reliability and efficiency of network transmissions due to errors and interferences in wireless communications and to other challenges. They are primarily responsible for regulating access to the shared medium. There are a lot of protocols developed to protect from DOS attack, but it is not completely possible. One such DOS attack is vampire attacks which cause damage in network. Secure level is low; productivity reduces which leads to environmental disasters and cause loss in the information. Routing protocols play an important role in modern wireless communication networks. Hence propose Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (IGRP) where router used it to exchange routing data within an independent system. In WSN routing protocols find the route between nodes and ensure the consistent communication between the nodes in the network.},

abstract = {This paper provides an overview of the Internet of Things (IoT) with emphasis on enabling technologies, protocols and application issues. The IoT is enabled by the latest developments in RFID, smart sensors, communication technologies and Internet protocols. The basic premise is to have smart sensors collaborate directly without human involvement to deliver a new class of applications. The current revolution in Internet, mobile and machine-to-machine (M2M) technologies can be seen as the first phase of the IoT. In the coming years, the IoT is expected to bridge diverse technologies to enable new applications by connecting physical objects together in support of intelligent decision making. This paper starts by providing a horizontal overview of the IoT. Then, we give an overview of some technical details that pertain to the IoT enabling technologies, protocols and applications. Compared to other survey papers in the field, our objective is to provide a more thorough summary of the most relevant protocols and application issues to enable researchers and application developers to get up to speed quickly on how the different protocols fit together to deliver desired functionalities without having to go through RFCs and the standards specifications. We also provide an overview of some of the key IoT challenges presented in the recent literature and provide a summary of related research work. Moreover, we explore the relation between the IoT and other emerging technologies including big data analytics and cloud and fog computing. We also present the need for better horizontal integration among IoT services. Finally, we present detailed service use-cases to illustrate how the different protocols presented in the paper fit together to deliver desired IoT services.},

abstract = {In today's world of home automation, smart objects are interconnected and participate in the Internet of Things. Being part of a very sensible eco-system, these entities must be secured against various kinds of attacks. Smart home appliances such as light bulbs or window shutters have very low processing power and networking capacities and more often than not lack of input/output devices such as keyboards or displays. Therefore, special protocols have been developed to enable lightweight and secure communication. Yet, the secure configuration of new nodes in a network has not been solved satisfactory. In this paper we present a three-phase protocol to bootstrap constrained devices in a wireless sensor network based on IPv6 and the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP). The protocol phases include service discovery, distribution of security credentials, and application-specific node configuration.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {The objective of this case study was to obtain some first-hand information about the functional consequences of a cosmetic tongue split operation for speech and tongue motility. One male patient who had performed the operation on himself was interviewed and underwent a tongue motility assessment, as well as an ultrasound examination. Tongue motility was mildly reduced as a result of tissue scarring. Speech was rated to be fully intelligible and highly acceptable by 4 raters, although 2 raters noticed slight distortions of the sibilants /s/ and /z/. The 3-dimensional ultrasound demonstrated that the synergy of the 2 sides of the tongue was preserved. A notably deep posterior genioglossus furrow indicated compensation for the reduced length of the tongue blade. It is concluded that the tongue split procedure did not significantly affect the participant's speech intelligibility and tongue motility.},

The proposed architecture integrates an intrusion detection system (IDS) into the network framework developed within the EU FP7 project ebbits. The aim is to detect DoS attacks based on 6LoWPAN. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed architecture, preliminary implementation was completed and tested against a real DoS attack using a penetration testing system. The paper concludes with the related results proving to be successful in detecting DoS attacks on 6LoWPAN. Further, extending the IDS could lead to detect more complex attacks on 6LoWPAN.},

abstract = {Responding to the increasing interest to connect wireless sensor networks (WSN) to the Internet, the IETF has proposed standards that enable IPv6-based sensor networks. Specifically, the IETF 6LoWPAN and RoLL working groups developed standards for en- capsulating IPv6 datagrams in 802.15.4 frames, neighbor discov- ery, and routing that allow sensor networks to exchange IPv6 data- grams with Internet hosts. However, given that these standards, es- pecially the RPL routing protocol, are relatively new, there has not yet been a study that measures the actual performance of these pro- posals using real implementations. In this work, we use the BLIP and TinyRPL implementations in TinyOS 2.x to evaluate the per- formance of the newly proposed standards and compare them with CTP, the de-facto routing protocol standard for TinyOS. Our results indicate that the performance of TinyRPL is comparable with CTP and at the same time, TinyRPL can provide additional functionali- ties that traditional WSN routing protocols could not provide. We also discovered several issues, relevant to system developers and the standardization groups, which can enhance the proposed stan- dards’ performance.},

abstract = { Sleep deprivation attacks are a form of denial of service attack whereby an attacker renders a pervasive computing device inoperable by draining the battery more quickly than it would be drained under normal usage. We describe three main methods for an attacker to drain the battery: (1) service request power attacks, where repeated requests are made to the victim for services, typically over a network - even if the service is not provided the victim must expend energy deciding whether or not to honor the request; (2) benign power attacks, where the victim is made to execute a valid but energy-hungry task repeatedly, and (3) malignant power attacks, where the attacker modifies or creates an executable to make the system consume more energy than it would otherwise. Our initial results demonstrate the increased power consumption due to these attacks, which we believe are the first real examples of these attacks to appear in the literature. We also propose a power-secure architecture to thwart these power attacks by employing multi-level authentication and energy signatures.},

abstract = {Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are a technology with high potential to be employed in several industrial and quotidian situations. Self-organization and self-configuration are key characteristics of WSNs. In most situations, these characteristics are useful because they minimize the configuration efforts and simultaneously increase the network robustness in case of failures or topology changes. However, they can also be exploited to perform security attacks, since third party nodes can easily join the network and, then, use it to compromise legitimate nodes and to send messages to the Internet. This paper presents a mechanism that can be used to control the nodes that have access to WSNs with 6LoWPAN support. It is based on administrative approval, preventing third party nodes from using the network to communicate with regular nodes. It uses standard protocols which are present in all 6LoWPAN compliant networks, such as 6LoWPAN Neighbor Discover protocol and RPL routing protocol. This paper also presents the design and deployment of a laboratory testbed that validates the proposed solution.},

abstract = {We have witnessed the Fixed Internet emerging with virtually every computer being connected today; we are currently witnessing the emergence of the Mobile Internet with the exponential explosion of smart phones, tablets and net-books. However, both will be dwarfed by the anticipated emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT), in which everyday objects are able to connect to the Internet, tweet or be queried. Whilst the impact onto economies and societies around the world is undisputed, the technologies facilitating such a ubiquitous connectivity have struggled so far and only recently commenced to take shape. To this end, this paper introduces in a timely manner and for the first time the wireless communications stack the industry believes to meet the important criteria of power-efficiency, reliability and Internet connectivity. Industrial applications have been the early adopters of this stack, which has become the de- facto standard, thereby bootstrapping early IoT developments with already thousands of wireless nodes deployed. Corroborated throughout this paper and by emerging industry alliances, we believe that a standardized approach, using latest developments in the IEEE 802.15.4 and IETF working groups, is the only way forward.We introduce and relate key embodiments of the power-efficient IEEE 802.15.4-2006 PHY layer, the power- saving and reliable IEEE 802.15.4e MAC layer, the IETF 6LoW- PAN adaptation layer enabling universal Internet connectivity, the IETF ROLL routing protocol enabling availability, and finally the IETF CoAP enabling seamless transport and support of Internet applications. The protocol stack proposed in the present work converges towards the standardized notations of the ISO/OSI and TCP/IP stacks. What thus seemed impossible some years back, i.e., building a clearly defined, standards-compliant and Internet- compliant stack given the extreme restrictions of IoT networks, is commencing to become reality.},

Although RPL defines basic security modes, it remains vulnerable to topological attacks which facilitate blackholing, interception, and resource exhaustion. We are concerned with analyzing the corresponding threats and protecting future RPL deployments from such attacks. Our contributions are twofold. First, we analyze the state of the art, in particular the protective scheme VeRA and present two new rank order attacks as well as extensions to mitigate them. Second, we derive and evaluate TRAIL, a generic scheme for topology authentication in RPL. TRAIL solely relies on the basic assumptions of RPL that (1) the root node serves as a trust anchor and (2) each node interconnects to the root in a straight hierarchy. Using proper reachability tests, TRAIL scalably and reliably identifies any topological attacker without strong cryptographic efforts.},

A requirement for large-scaled deployment are extremely low-cost sensors though running with minimal resources regarding computational power, energy consumption, and memory size. Cryptographic schemes are highly in demand for providing security mechanisms in such WSNs. Asymmetric cryptography allows for flexible key management schemes at the cost of high resource demands whereas symmetric cryptography provides resource efficient solutions. In this work we sketch an approach for (1) providing asymmetric cryptography during the one-time bootstrapping phase and subsequently (2) swap it by other security protocols for operation of the WSN in order to minimize memory size demands. Our mechanism is based on dynamic code update, e.g. provided by the FlexCup plug-in for TinyOS. Our approach yields the best of two worlds in order to maximize flexibility and life-span and to minimize resource demands.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) enables a wide range of application scenarios with potentially critical actuating and sensing tasks, e.g., in the e-health domain. For communication at the application layer, resource-constrained devices are expected to employ the constrained application protocol (CoAP) that is currently being standardized at the Internet Engineering Task Force. To protect the transmission of sensitive information, secure CoAP mandates the use of datagram transport layer security (DTLS) as the underlying security protocol for authenticated and confidential communication. DTLS, however, was originally designed for comparably powerful devices that are interconnected via reliable, high-bandwidth links. In this paper, we present Lithe-an integration of DTLS and CoAP for the IoT. With Lithe, we additionally propose a novel DTLS header compression scheme that aims to significantly reduce the energy consumption by leveraging the 6LoWPAN standard. Most importantly, our proposed DTLS header compression scheme does not compromise the end-to-end security properties provided by DTLS. Simultaneously, it considerably reduces the number of transmitted bytes while maintaining DTLS standard compliance. We evaluate our approach based on a DTLS implementation for the Contiki operating system. Our evaluation results show significant gains in terms of packet size, energy consumption, processing time, and network-wide response times when compressed DTLS is enabled.},

Prior security work in this area has focused primarily on denial of communication at the routing or medium access control levels. This paper explores resource depletion attacks at the routing protocol layer, which permanently disable networks by quickly draining nodes' battery power. These "Vampire" attacks are not specific to any specific protocol, but rather rely on the properties of many popular classes of routing protocols. We find that all examined protocols are susceptible to Vampire attacks, which are devastating, difficult to detect, and are easy to carry out using as few as one malicious insider sending only protocol-compliant messages. In the worst case, a single Vampire can increase network-wide energy usage by a factor of O(N), where N in the number of network nodes. We discuss methods to mitigate these types of attacks, including a new proof-of-concept protocol that provably bounds the damage caused by Vampires during the packet forwarding phase.},

With the emergence of Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM), privacy preservation of smart meter data becomes very important for an individual. Emerging solution provides privacy breach minimization by supervised learning through training that incurs higher capex and opex. IoT systems do not consist of human-in-loop. So, involuntary approach of privacy preservation is to be employed. In this paper, we propose a novel solution for addressing the problem of involuntary privacy breaching risk minimization in smart energy management systems. Our proposed solution `Dynamic Privacy Analyzer' scheme is an attempt towards achieving a unique privacy metric that is derived from fundamental principles like robust statistics and information theory. We analyze the performance of our scheme with large set of publicly available real smart meter datasets and evaluate optimality criteria like utility-privacy trade-off. Efficacy of our proposed scheme is demonstrated by minimizing the capability of privacy intruders like NILM. To the best of our knowledge, for the first time the involuntary privacy-aware scheme tailored for IoT system is proposed. Our proposed scheme is generic enough to suit in other IoT applications.},

abstract = {The IETF work in IPv6 over Low-power Wireless Personal Area Network (6LoWPAN) defines 6LoWPANs such as IEEE 802.15.4. This and other similar link technologies have limited or no usage of multicast signaling due to energy conservation. In addition, the wireless network may not strictly follow the traditional concept of IP subnets and IP links. IPv6 Neighbor Discovery was not designed for non- transitive wireless links, as its reliance on the traditional IPv6 link concept and its heavy use of multicast make it inefficient and sometimes impractical in a low-power and lossy network. This document describes simple optimizations to IPv6 Neighbor Discovery, its addressing mechanisms, and duplicate address detection for Low- power Wireless Personal Area Networks and similar networks. The document thus updates RFC 4944 to specify the use of the optimizations defined here.},

abstract = {Low-Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) are a class of network in which both the routers and their interconnect are constrained. LLN routers typically operate with constraints on processing power, memory, and energy (battery power). Their interconnects are characterized by high loss rates, low data rates, and instability. LLNs are comprised of anything from a few dozen to thousands of routers. Supported traffic flows include point-to-point (between devices inside the LLN), point-to-multipoint (from a central control point to a subset of devices inside the LLN), and multipoint-to-point (from devices inside the LLN towards a central control point). This document specifies the IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL), which provides a mechanism whereby multipoint-to-point traffic from devices inside the LLN towards a central control point as well as point-to-multipoint traffic from the central control point to the devices inside the LLN are supported. Support for point-to-point traffic is also available.},

abstract = {The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is a specialized web transfer protocol for use with constrained nodes and constrained (e.g., low-power, lossy) networks. The nodes often have 8-bit microcontrollers with small amounts of ROM and RAM, while constrained networks such as IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPANs) often have high packet error rates and a typical throughput of 10s of kbit/s. The protocol is designed for machine- to-machine (M2M) applications such as smart energy and building automation. CoAP provides a request/response interaction model between application endpoints, supports built-in discovery of services and resources, and includes key concepts of the Web such as URIs and Internet media types. CoAP is designed to easily interface with HTTP for integration with the Web while meeting specialized requirements such as multicast support, very low overhead, and simplicity for constrained environments.},

abstract = {MQTT is a Client Server publish/subscribe messaging transport protocol. It is light weight, open, simple, and designed so as to be easy to implement. These characteristics make it ideal for use in many situations, including constrained environments such as for communication in Machine to Machine (M2M) and Internet of Things (IoT) contexts where a small code footprint is required and/or network bandwidth is at a premium. The protocol runs over TCP/IP, or over other network protocols that provide ordered, lossless, bi- directional connections. Its features include: Use of the publish/subscribe message pattern which provides one-to-many message distribution and decoupling of applications. A messaging transport that is agnostic to the content of the payload.

This level could be used, for example, with ambient sensor data where it does not matter if an individual reading is lost as the next one will be published soon after. "At least once", where messages are assured to arrive but duplicates can occur. "Exactly once", where message are assured to arrive exactly once. This level could be used, for example, with billing systems where duplicate or lost messages could lead to incorrect charges being applied. A small transport overhead and protocol exchanges minimized to reduce network traffic. A mechanism to notify interested parties when an abnormal disconnection occurs.},
